# Master Thesis 
## Axel Vislie Mikkelsen and August Heiervang Dahl

This repository is made in connection with our master's thesis in Engineering and ICT at NTNU. 
Please follow the instructions below to run the simulation model:

* Download the AnyLogic University version (free 30-day trial): https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/
* Download this repository as a zip file and un-zip the folder in your preferred location
* Open AnyLogic University and the MasterThesis.alp file
* Navigate to the Monte Carlo Experiment (MC: Main) and run the file
* Choose one method (Conventional, Pathmind, Heuristic) and one of the 11 scenarios on the left-hand side
* If the heuristic method is chosen, you are free to choose one of the four pickup/release policy combinations listed. Note that the pickup/release policy is only available for the heuristic method. 
* Start the experiment in the bottom left corner. The performance statistics will appear in the histograms.
* If you want to compare different methods, you can do the following:
  1. Wait until the first experiment is finished
  2. Click on the pause button in the bottom left corner
  3. Change to the method you want to compare with and run the experiment again

It is also possible to run a single simulation run to analyze the forklifts' behavior. To do this, you follow the same procedure as above, but now with the Simulation Experiment (Simulation: Main)
